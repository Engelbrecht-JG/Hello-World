# Hello-World
Hello, world! My name is JG Engelbrecht, a post-grad researcher from Durban, South Africa.
 
I'm new to coding, and especially new to GitHub. But, I am ready to take the next steps in my programming journey and join in contributing to other works too.
I look forward to continue to learn from this great platform and wonderful community!

## About me: 
I am a young, radical, social economist. My specialities are policy, macroeconomics, public economics, and community livelihoods. 
My motivations are simple: through all that I do, I just want to help make the world a better place.

Also, I love music, pets, sunny weather, and good vibes!

## Why I'm here:
Like I said, I'm pretty new to this coding stuff. But, it is an invaluable tool that I know can unlock so many possibilities for me as I progress my academic work.
With that said, I know especially well how it feels to be in the dark, so it's my aim to make pages, posts, and code that helps add a bit of light. As I learn to implement new tools and techniques, I'll make simplified instructions and demos so that newer members can get the most out of it too.
I want to keep it simple, accessible, and easy, so that every person and newbie can make sense of it. After all, that seems to be the sort from whom I've learned the most :)
